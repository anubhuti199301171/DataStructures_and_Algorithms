/*
The algorithm which we are going to use over here is called the "Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm", which is the fastest possible
solution to the given problem.
What we do is we traverse the given linked list using two  pointers and keep moving them forward, one moves one step forward after
every iteration and the other moves two steps forward after every iteration and if in any instance both of them are equal means
a loop exists otherwise not.
