/*
Circlular linked list(CLL)
a circular linkd list can be singly or doubly linked list!
the only change is that the next of the last node is not null, rather it points to the head
Advantages:
1. We can traverse thorugh the entire list from anywhere and not just the head, the only thing is we have to stop when we the
node we started from is visited again.
2. useful implementation of Queue
3. very useful in cases when we need go through the list repeatedly
4. circular doubly linked lists helps in implemention of advanced data structure like fibonacci
