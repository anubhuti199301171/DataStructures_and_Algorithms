Minimum Deletions 
Easy 
Given a string of S as input. Your task is to write a program to remove or delete the minimum number of characters from the string so that the resultant string is a palindrome.
Note: The order of characters in the string should be maintained.

Example 1:

Input: S = "aebcbda"
Output: 2
Explanation: Remove characters 'e' 
and 'd'.
â€‹Example 2:

Input: S = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: 8
Explanation: One of the possible result
string can be "eefee", so answer is 
13 - 5 = 8.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minimumNumberOfDeletions() which takes the string S as inputs and returns the minimum number of deletions required to convert S into a pallindrome.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|2)

Constraints:
1 = |S| = 103
